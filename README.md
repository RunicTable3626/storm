## About The Project

All digital action platforms that I saw were proprietary to large non-profits, leveraging their network effect and resources in order to supplement their digital campaigns. I made this to offer a similar opportunity to organize grassroots campaigns!

### Built With

This is built using the MERN stack
* MongoDB (a NoSQL database used for non-relational data)
* Express.js (Server-side tool to make it easier to deploy Node.js backends to the web)
* React.js (Frontend library to render a functional user interface)
* Node.js (backend framework that helps power the tofu and potatoes of this thing)
